# wdi-project-1
My first project for WDI London
This is my first WDI project.

Introduction

My aim was twofold. Firstly I wanted to practice and build upon what I’ve learnt with HTML, CSS and Javascript in the first two weeks of my WDI course. Secondly, I wanted to create a cool and clean game that could test users’ knowledge of capital cities across the world. A hosted verision of my game can be found here:

How to play

When you load the page you'll be prompted to click the start button. Immediately after clicking the start button you’ll be asked the capital city of a randomly selected country and the race against the clock begins. You'll score a point for each question you answer correctly and the goal is to score as many points as possible in a minute.
